`This setup is important because it ensures that every other part of the accounting module works in accordance with this data.`

#### Opening Balance

Like if someone send money their must be someone who recived it.
```

B = 500                     // intial balance of B
A sent 50 rupess to B       // Transtion happening
A = A-50 and B = B + 50     //  Transtion happening
A = 50                     // Final balance of A
B = 550                    // Final balance of B
```
#### Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice

Managing company shares can be done directly within your ERP system. There are two key elements to this:

1. Creating shareholders in the system ( any person, company, or other institution that owns at least one share of your company’s stock.)
1. Logging share transfers

ERP using share transfer entries if we required we explore this too.
### Billing and Invoicing
Alredy talked above.

### Taxes

 We have to set tax rules and tax categories for automation of tax on each transtaion in form of (TDS, VAT, GST e.t.c). 

For item-wise taxation, you can create item tax templates. This is useful if some of your items have different tax rates from the standard tax rate, as it lets you assign modified tax rates to specific items (or group of items). Then, when transactions are made with these items, the custom tax rate overrides the standard tax rate.

### Returns and Credit

When allocating credit to a customer, So, that we can provide goods or servised without clearing upfront money.
We can also set credit limit.
